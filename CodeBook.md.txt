Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean

The complete list of variables of each feature vector is available in 'features.txt'

How to get the file and intermediate variable descriptions

Code name : run_analysis.R

In the first step it will create a folder caled 'GETDATA033',which will be used any further operations realted to this program.

The latest content are downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip. 
The contents are unzipped and kept it there.

the contents are read into the data frame

features 		: features.txt is read here. 
activity_labels	:activity_labels.txt
X_test		:X_test.txt is laoded here.		
subject_test	:subject_test.txt is laoded here.
y_test		:y_test.txt is laoded here.
y_test_final	:y_test,activity_labels are marged by V1
X_test_final	:subject_test,y_test_final,X_test are marged.

X_train		:X_train.txt
subject_train	:subject_train.txt
y_train		:y_train.txt
y_train_final	:y_train,activity_labels are marged by V1
X_train_final	:subject_train,y_train_final,X_train are combined

X_Final : X_train_final,X_test_final are column binded.

Final_Col_list :  The meadn and std colun locations are fetched and storred
All_mean_std_	:Only meand and STD columns are fetched here.

aggdata		:data is aggregatted (mean) by Subject and activity and finally ordered by subjecta and activity.


In the last step the data is written tnot one file called 'getdata-033.txt' 

For any further use of the raw data is also available in the file 'getdata-033_All_mean_std.txt'
